It all became so lovely
Em7
Those bluest skies above me
Gm7  F#m   F
Those funny feelings I had never felt before I met you
Dmaj7
I thought I'd stay a while
Em7
I tried to learn to smile
Gm7  F#m  B7(b9)
So many colours I had never even known

Em7 A F#m  B7(b9)
Maybe I'd find myself sitting on that distant shore
Em7  Gm7  A Dmaj7
Maybe I'm not alone

Bbmaj7
Then I see the colours fading
Dmaj7
Gentleness of light escaping
Bbmaj7
Shadows of my fear invading
C Asus
Have I seen this all before?

I know 
Dmaj7
that there's something residing
Em7
That terror deep inside me
Gm7  F#m  B7(b9)
I couldn't understand how you could be so bold

Em7 A F#m  B7(b9)
Maybe I'd find myself sitting on that distant shore
Em7  Gm7  A D
Maybe I'm not alone
